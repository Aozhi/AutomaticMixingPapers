# Automatic Mixing Research
This repository serves to track and archive scientific work in the area of automatic multitrack audio mixing.

## Overview
Mixing is a complex process carried out by audio engineers during the music production process. It involves a number of different steps each of which oftentimes have many substeps dependent on the source material and the desired result. In order to better categorize the work in this area the following mix processes are identified.

### Cateogories
* `Level`
* `Panning`
* `Equalization`
* `Compresssion`
* `Reverb`

Systems that incorporate more than one procees are categorized as `Integrated`.

### Approaches
A number of different approaches have been employed to address the research problem of automatic mixing. They are organized using these three labels as outlined in [A Semantic Approach To Autonomous Mixing](http://arpjournal.com/a-semantic-approach-to-autonomous-mixing/) by Brecht De Man and Joshua D. Reiss.

* `Grounded Theory` ( `GT` ) - Using pyschoacoustic or perceptual evaluation to design a mixing systems
* `Knowledge Engineering` ( `KE` ) - Using collected 'best practices' to design a mixing system
* `Machine Learning` ( `ML` ) - Using mulitrack mix data from audio engineers to train a mathematical model for a mixing system
