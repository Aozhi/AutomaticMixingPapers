# Automatic Mixing Research
This list serves to track and archive scienific work in the area of automatic multitrack audio mixing. 

## Overview
Mixing is a complex process carried out by audio engineers during the music production process. It involves a number of different steps each of which often times have many substeps dependent on the source material and the desired result. In order to better categorize the work in this area the following mix processes are indentified.

* `Level`
* `Panning`
* `Equalization`
* `Compresssion`
* `Reverb`

Systems that incorporate more than one procees are categorized as `integrated`.
